# LLM From Scratch

This project was made for studying LLMs and how they're implemented without any abstraction libraries such as those made by Hugging Face. The goal is to implement a basic GPT-2-esque LLM with libraries consisting of the standard library, PyTorch and Pandas. The idea of using 4chan as the basis for the training dataset came from this Kitboga-lookalike [Yannic Kilcher's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efPrtcLdcdM).

TODO:
- FP16
- Optimize hyperparameters

Not planned:
- Custom tokenizer
